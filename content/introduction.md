**Main project of my 2020 Summer Internship at [Tezign](http://tezign.com) in Shanghai, China**  

# Main Goal
The main goal of this project is to analyze image data sets of advertisements and
develop machine learning algorithms to generate advertising images. The data analyzed is
used to to develop models and algorithms to generate images created by Artificial Intelligence.


## Sub-Goals
1. [Creating Heatmaps](heatmap)
2. [Linear Regression](regression)
3. Display Findings


# Heatmaps
Analyzing image's components or layers to create heatmaps of their locations.
A total of 14 image layers where analyzed to create heatmaps for each layer.


# Linear Regression Analysis
Using various linear regression algorithms to generate images based on image layer data.
Each algorithm's error was found to determine the accuracy of models.
