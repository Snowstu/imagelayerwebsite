## Project Details

This website was created to display the results of my Image Layer Analysis Project. I analyzed image layer data sets from advertising images using machine learning algorithms to generate artificially created images. Many different types of regression algorithms were used throughout this project.

This website was created from using a GatsbyJS website framework and written using GitBook Markdown. The website is deployed using Netlify.
